      Concepts of OOPS : 
        
        -> CLASS - Class is a Blueprint of a Object.

        -> OBJECT - Object is an instance of a class or object refers to the class.

        ->INHERITANCE - Inheritance is using one class's property in other class
                      - Types of Inheritance :
                            
                            1.) Single Inheritance
                            2.) Multiple Inheritance
                            3.) Multilevel Inheritance  

        -> Encapsulation - Encapsulation is a wrapping up a data into an single unit

        -> Abstraction - Abstraction is hiding confidential data and showing only required information.

        -> Polymorphism - Doing an single thing in a multiple ways 
                        - Types of Polymorphism :

                            1.) Method Overloading (not Supported in python)
                                - It has same class name same method with different arguments
                            2.) Method Overriding 
                                - It has different class name with same method an arguments
